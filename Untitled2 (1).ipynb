    "Answer--Abstraction is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP)\n",
    "that focuses on simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors of real-world objects. \n",
    "It involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.\n",

    "Q2. Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.\n",
    "Answer--Abstraction and encapsulation are two important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that serve distinct purposes.\n",

    "Abstraction focuses on simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors of real-world objects.\n",

    "It is achieved through the creation of abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "Abstraction allows you to work with high-level concepts and interfaces without needing to know the intricate implementation details.\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit,\n",
    "known as a class.\n",
    "Encapsulation enforces data hiding, restricting the direct access to some of an \n",
    "object's components and allowing controlled access through methods.\n",
    "It helps in organizing code, preventing unauthorized modifications, and promoting data integrity.\n",

    "Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "Answer--The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\n",
    "\" It provides a framework for defining abstract base classes and creating interfaces that must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
    "Abstract base classes are classes that cannot be instantiated on their own and serve as templates for other classes.\n",
    "The abc module allows you to define abstract methods that must be overridden by concrete subclasses, ensuring a consistent interface and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module is used to enforce abstraction and interface consistency, as well as to provide a clear structure for designing\n",
    "and implementing classes.\n",
    "It is particularly helpful in situations where you want to define a common set of methods that multiple classes must implement, \n",
    "but you don't want to provide default implementations for those methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features and usage of the abc module:\n",
    "Abstract Base Classes (ABCs): The module provides the ABC class that serves as a base class for creating abstract base classes.\n",
    "Subclasses of ABC can define abstract methods using the @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forcing Method Implementation: The abstractmethod decorator is used to mark methods as abstract. \n",
    "Subclasses inheriting from an abstract base class must implement these abstract methods, or they will raise errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating Interfaces: You can define interfaces using abstract base classes. \n",
    "These interfaces specify a set of methods that must be implemented by classes that claim to conform to that interface.\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",

    "Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "Answer--Data abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves hiding the complex implementation details of data\n",
    "and showing only the necessary features and functionalities.\n",
    "It helps in managing complexity and providing a clear interface for interacting with objects. \n",
    "In Python, you can achieve data abstraction through the following techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use of Classes and Objects: Define classes that encapsulate data and methods that operate on the data.\n",
    "Objects of these classes provide a high-level interface for interacting with the data, while the implementation details are hidden within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private Attributes and Methods: By convention, you can use a single underscore (_) as a prefix to attribute\n",
    "and method names to indicate that they are meant to be \"protected\" or \"private.\"\n",
    "This indicates to developers that these members should not be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access Control: Use getter and setter methods to control access to attributes. \n",
    "This allows you to enforce specific rules or validations when getting or setting attribute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract Base Classes: Use the abc module to define abstract base classes with abstract methods.\n",
    "Subclasses must provide implementations for these methods, ensuring a consistent interface while hiding the implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Can we create an instance of an abstract class? Explain your answer.\n",
